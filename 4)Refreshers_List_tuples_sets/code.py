List = ["Saby", "Sourav", "Rohan"]  # list is defined by square/third brackets
# different values has to be separated by comas
# duplicate elements can coexist in a list like ex: ["Saby", "Sourav", "Rohan", "Saby"]
# ______________________________________________________________________________
Tuple = ("Saby", "Sourav", "Rohan")  # Tuple is defined by first/normal brackets
# you can not modify a tuple, you can add or remove elements from list but not from a tuple
# _________________________________________________________________________________
Set = {"Saby", "Sourav", "Rohan"}  # Sets is defined by curly braces or second brackets
# you can modify sets and also duplicate elements can not co-exist
# list and tuple have order but sets do not follow any order of elements
# that's why sets does not allow subscript notation
# ___________________________________________________________________________________
print(List[0])  # [0] is called subscript notation
# to print out the first element of the list
# __________________________________________________
print(Tuple[2])  # [2] is called subscript notation
# to print out the third element of the tuple
# _____________________________________________________________________________________
# print(set[1]) is wrong because sets does not allow subscript notation because
# sets do not follow any order of elements

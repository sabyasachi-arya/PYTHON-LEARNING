# Boolean logics
print(10 == 10)  # Here the output will be True, because this boolean expression is True
print(5 == 6)  # Here the output will be False, because this boolean expression is False
# This is basically used to compare things
print(180 > 200)  # 180 is not bigger than 200, so output will false
print(180 < 200)  # 180 is smaller than 200, so output will true
print(100 != 100)  # the output will be false because the expression suggests that 100 is
# not equal to 100 and which is false expression
# other comparison expressions such as : ==, !=, >, <, >=, <=
